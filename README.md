# SentimentAnalysis_NLP

**AI Echo: Sentiment Analysis of ChatGPT Reviews** is a data science project that analyzes user feedback to understand public sentiment about ChatGPT. The project covers the entire machine learning pipeline â€” from data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, and balancing) to exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering with TF-IDF, and sentiment classification using ML models such as Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, and Random Forest. A web-based dashboard built with Streamlit allows interactive visualizations of review trends (ratings, helpfulness, keywords, etc.) and lets users enter their own reviews to predict sentiment in real time.
